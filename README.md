# **Employee Tracker**

## **Description**
The purpose of this project was to build a command-line application with Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to manage a company's employee database. This content management system allows the user to choose from a menu of options to view department, roles, and employee data; add departments, roles, and employees; and update an employee's role. The program connects on to a MySQL database on the back end so that information can be transferred to the user in the form of displayed data tables or from the user and stored into a MySQL database.
